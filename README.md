The project is a machine learning solution that allows audiences to experience video content in their preferred language, while maintaining the natural mouth movements of the speaker. By leveraging advanced speech-to-text, language translation, and video synthesis techniques, this project will create a seamless experience where the speaker's voice is accurately translated, and their lip movements are synchronized to match the translated audio.
Objectives:
•	Create a machine learning model that translates English speech into multiple target languages, while preserving speaker-specific characteristics like tone and emotion.
•	Develop a video synthesis module that adjusts mouth movements and facial expressions to align with the translated audio.
•	Ensure real-time or near real-time processing to enable live video translation applications.

### Key Deliverables:
1.	Speech-to-Text Module – Accurately transcribe spoken English audio in real-time.
2.	Translation Module – Translate into target languages e.g French
3.	Speech Synthesis Module – Produce audio output of target language translation, preserving emotional tone and speech characteristics.
4.	Lip Sync Video Generator – Generate video where the speaker’s lip movements are matched to the translated audio, using video synthesis.
5.	User Interface Prototype – Develop a basic user interface for demonstrating the solution’s capabilities in real-time.
